### Allo 👋

I'm a Systems Engineer with a passion for Ansible, PowerShell, and automation of all things possible!  

📫 You can reach me at `tigattack` on Discord.  
✏️ You can check out [my blog](https://blog.tiga.tech) if you like, it's a bit dead though.  
⚙️ I work with:
* Automation (Ansible/AWX & Ansible Tower/Terraform/Packer/PowerShell DSC);
* PowerShell, Bash, some Python scripting;
* Cloud platforms (AWS/Azure/GCP), on-premise tech (vSphere, Veeam, physical server/storage/network infrastructure, etc);
* Most operating systems (Windows Server/Linux/macOS);
* More... 🙂
