### Allo 👋

I'm a Systems Engineer with a passion for Ansible, PowerShell, and automation of all things possible!  

📫 You can reach me at `tigattack#7987` on Discord.  
✏️ You can check out [my blog](https://blog.tiga.tech) if you like, it's a bit dead though.  
⚙️ I'm experienced with:
* Automation (Ansible/AWX & Ansible Tower/Terraform/Packer/PowerShell DSC), most operating systems (Windows Server/Linux/macOS).
* Cloud platforms (AWS/Azure & M365/GCP), on-premise technologies (vSphere/Hyper-V, Veeam, physical server/storage/network infrastructure).
* PowerShell, Bash, some Python scripting.
* Much more...
