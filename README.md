### Allo 👋

I do all sorts on personal time, but my primary focuses are PowerShell and automation of all the things!  
On work time, I do a a mixture of infrastucture & cloud engineering/automation, DevOps, and SecOps.

🔭 I’m currently working on all sorts of stuff, whatever I happen to throw myself into today!

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on my [VeeamDiscordNotifications](https://github.com/tigattack/VeeamDiscordNotifications) project.

💬 Ask me about PowerShell, if you really want to.
